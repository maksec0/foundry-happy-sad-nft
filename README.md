# Basic And Static NFT

## About:
This code creates two NFT types: static and dynamic based on IPFS and SVG.

The static NFT is based on IPFS and it will create an NFT of a dog of specific unchangeable image.

The dynamic NFT is based on SVG. It will create a dynamic NFT in which you can choose the mood of the dog created.
There are only two moods sad and happy.
Every time, you change the mood you need to delete the NFT and re-import it into your wallet. 

## Suggestions:
It will create an NFT of dogs, you can change it and choose whatever image you want.
Also, you can change the code to add more moods and attributes to each NFT created.

HAVE FUN!!
